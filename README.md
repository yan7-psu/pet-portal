This is a project for ECE 211/212.

The Pet Portal is a wireless, automated pet door that locks based on your pet's proximity. It uses two ESP-32s, one located in the pet collar and one at the pet door.
There also a temperature sensor inside of the pet collar and a web server used to control the door and display information about the collar.
